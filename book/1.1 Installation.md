# [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.html) - 1.1 Installation

## 1. Installation:
   
   - Rust is installed using rustup, a command line tool.
   - The website provides installation steps for Linux/macOS and Windows separately.
   - Rust's stability guarantees ensure that the examples in the book will work with newer Rust versions.

## 2. Installation on Linux/macOS:
   
   - Open the terminal and run the following command:
   ```sh
   $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
   ```
   - This command downloads a script and starts the installation process.
   - You might need to enter your password.
   - Once installed, a message indicating successful installation will appear.
   - Additionally I needed to add the the binaries to my `~/.zshrc`, with the following line:
   ```sh
   export PATH="/Users/tobias/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
   ```

## 3. Troubleshooting:

   - To check if Rust is installed correctly, run `$ rustc --version` in the shell.
   - The version number and commit information should be displayed.

## 4. Updating and Uninstalling:

   - To update Rust to a new version, run `$ rustup update` in the shell.
   - To uninstall Rust and rustup, use `$ rustup self uninstall`.

## 5. Local Documentation:

   - The Rust installation includes a local copy of the documentation.
   - Use the command `rustup doc` to open the local documentation in the browser.
   - The API documentation is useful for understanding types and functions from the standard library.
