# [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html) - 1.2 Hello World

## Using the [Rust compiler](what%20is/Rustc.md)

### 1. Create a project directory:
   - Open a terminal.
   - Enter the following commands to create a projects directory and a subdirectory for the "Hello, world!" project:
     ```sh
     $ mkdir ~/projects
     $ cd ~/projects
     $ mkdir hello_world
     $ cd hello_world
     ```

### 2. Write and save the Rust program:
   - Create a new file named `main.rs` in the `hello_world` directory.
   - Enter the following code in the `main.rs` file:
     ```rust
     fn main() {
         println!("Hello, world!");
     }
     ```

### 3. Compile and run the program:
   - In the terminal, navigate to the `hello_world` directory.
   - Enter the following commands to compile and run the program:
     ```sh
     $ rustc main.rs
     $ ./main
     ```

### 4. Verify the output:
   - The terminal should display `Hello, world!` as the output of the program.
   - If you encounter any issues, refer to the troubleshooting section for assistance.

## Using [Cargo](what%20is/Cargo.md)

By following these steps, you can create, build, and run a simple "Hello, World!" Rust application using Cargo. Cargo provides additional functionality for managing dependencies and organizing more complex projects, making it a valuable tool for Rust development.

### 1. Create a project with Cargo:
   - Navigate to your desired project directory in the terminal.
   - Run the following command to create a new project named `hello_cargo`:
     ```sh
     $ cargo new hello_cargo
     $ cd hello_cargo
     ```
   - To turn an existing directory in a cargo project, run:
     ```sh
     $ cd project-dir
     $ cargo init --name project-name
     ```

### 2. Review project structure:
   - The project is created with a `Cargo.toml` file and a `src` directory containing a `main.rs` file.
   - `Cargo.toml` is the configuration file for the project, while `main.rs` contains the code.

### 3. Build and run the project:
   - From the `hello_cargo` directory, run the following command to build the project:
     ```sh
     $ cargo build
     ```
   - Once the build is successful, run the executable with the following command:
     ```sh
     $ ./target/debug/hello_cargo # or .\target\debug\hello_cargo.exe on Windows
     ```
   - We can also use `cargo run` to compile the code and then run the resultant executable all in one command:
     ```sh
     $ cargo run
     ```
   - In both cases, the terminal should display `Hello, world!` as the output.
   - `cargo build` creates the file `Cargo.lock` which keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies

### 4. Using `cargo check`:
   - Instead of building the executable, you can quickly check for errors in your code using the command:
     ```sh
     $ cargo check
     ```

### 5. Building for release:
   - When your project is ready for release, use the following command to compile it with optimizations:
     ```sh
     $ cargo build --release
     ```
   - The release build will create an optimized executable in the `target/release` directory.
