# Rustc

- Rust code can be written in any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of choice.
- The Rust program is written in a source file named `main.rs`, following the convention of using the `.rs` extension.
- The program consists of a `main` function, which is the entry point for every Rust executable.
- Compiling the program is done using the `rustc` command followed by the source file name.
- After successful compilation, an executable file is generated.
- The executable can be run using the appropriate command (`./main` on Linux/macOS, or `.\main.exe` on Windows).
- Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, allowing you to distribute and run executables without needing Rust installed.
- For larger projects and code sharing, the [Cargo tool](Cargo.md) is introduced as a more comprehensive solution.
