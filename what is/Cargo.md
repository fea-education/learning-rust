# Cargo

- Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager used by most Rust developers.
- Cargo handles tasks such as building code, managing dependencies, and downloading required libraries.
- The "Hello, world!" program doesn't have dependencies, but as projects become more complex, dependencies can be easily managed with Cargo.
- Cargo comes installed with Rust if you used the official installers; otherwise, it can be installed separately.
- Creating a new project with Cargo involves using the `cargo new` command, which generates project files and directories.
- The project structure includes a `Cargo.toml` configuration file and a `src` directory with a `main.rs` file containing the code.
- Building the project with Cargo is done using the `cargo build` command, which creates an executable in the `target/debug` directory.
- Running the executable can be done with `cargo run`, which compiles and executes the code.
- `cargo check` quickly checks the code for errors without producing an executable.
- `cargo build --release` compiles the project with optimizations, creating an executable in the `target/release` directory for release purposes.
- Cargo provides consistent commands across different operating systems.
- Using Cargo becomes more valuable as projects grow in complexity and require managing dependencies or multiple files.
- Cargo coordinates the build process, making it easier to work with intricate programs.
- Further information about Cargo can be found in its documentation.
