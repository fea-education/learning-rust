# 2. Installing Rust

As recommended on [Rust's website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), I used the following command to download Rustup and install Rust:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Additionally I needed to add the the binaries to my `~/.zshrc`, with the following line:

```sh
export PATH="/Users/tobias/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```
